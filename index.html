    <h2><a href="https://nerd-of-now.github.io/NCP-VGC-Damage-Calculator/">VGC Damage Calculator</a></h2>
    <p class="body_text">I have been working on a damage calculator tailor-made for the VGC community. It has been unofficially forked from the <a href="http://www.trainertower.com">Trainer Tower</a> calculator (which itself is an unofficial fork of the <a href="http://www.nuggetbridge.com">Nugget Bridge</a> calculator), which I helped with maintenance on in 2020. Due to the discontinuation of Trainer Tower, it is now part of <a href="http://www.nimbasacitypost.com">Nimbasa City Post</a>.</p>
